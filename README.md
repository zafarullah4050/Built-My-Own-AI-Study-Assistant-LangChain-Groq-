# 🚀 Built My Own AI Study Assistant (LangChain + Groq) 🎙️📄

I just finished creating an **AI-powered Study Assistant** using **Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq LLMs**.

✨ What it does:
✅ Accepts **three input modes** → Text, Voice, or PDF
✅ **Summarizes** study notes into simple bullet points
✅ Generates **quiz questions & answers**
✅ Creates **flashcards (Q&A format)** for quick revision
✅ Builds a **personalized study schedule** (with breaks ⏳)
✅ Reads aloud summaries using **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**

🛠️ **Tech Stack**:

* Streamlit (UI)
* LangChain (prompts + memory)
* Groq LLMs (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`)
* SpeechRecognition (STT)
* gTTS (TTS)
* PyPDF2 (PDF reading)
* Python Dotenv (API key management)

💡 Why I built this?
Because students (including me 👨‍🎓) often struggle with time management, revision, and keeping study material engaging. With AI, learning can be **smarter, faster, and more fun**.

🚀 Next Steps:

* Adding support for **Gemma & Mixtral models**
* Improving UI/UX
* Deploying online for others to use

🔑 Key takeaway → **AI + Education = Limitless possibilities**
